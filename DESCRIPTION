Title: Quickly and Neatly Collect Arguments from One Environment to Pass to Another
Version: 0.4.0
Authors@R: c(Rick = person(given="Rick", family="Saporta", email="RickSaporta@gmail.com", role=c("aut","cre"), comment=NULL))
Description: We often want to take all (or most) of the objects in one environment (such as the parameter values of a function) and pass them to another. This might be calling a second function, or iterating over a list, calling the same function. These functions wrap often repeated code.
